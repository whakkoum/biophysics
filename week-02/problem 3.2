# Standard setup
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a random number generator
from numpy.random import default_rng
rng = default_rng()

# Draw from the Uniform Distribution
rand = rng.random

# The output of rand() < 0.5 was simply either "True" or "False"
# It would simulate a coin flip outcome because the odds are 50/50 to get either heads or tails
# which is the same outcome of the code true/false.

s = rand(6) < 0.5                 # generates a random number less than 0.5 that consistes of 6 decimal places 
x = np.sum(s / 2**np.arange(1,7)) # the arrange command creates an array [1,2,3,4,5,7] where python raises the number 2 to the power of each number in this array and divide s by that number. Then the sum command adds up all the values. 

print("x= {}".format(x))          # This line prints the overall sum.

a = []                                  # this line is to create an empty list to add values to it later using the for loop
for i in range(6000):                   # creates a for loop that start counting from 0 and ends at 5,999 to end up with a total of 6000 times
    s = rand(6) < 0.5                   
    x = np.sum(s / 2**np.arange(1,7))
    a.append(x)                         # adds x value to the end of array a to end up with 6,000 elements at the end of the for loop


plt.hist(a, rwidth=.9)      # creates a histogram with the values of the array (a)
